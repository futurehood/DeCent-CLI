# DeCent-CLI

DeCent-CLI is a Node.js-compatible toolset for building, testing, validating, managing, and self-hosting decentralized web apps (DWAs). The package is also available on NPM <a href="">here</a>.

NOTE: An implementation of a DCNT server is included in the package to provide DCNT peer connection signaling and a self-hosted SSL/TLS context for locally-installed DWAs. The server class presumably has unrealized security vulnerabilities, so exposing it to a public network directly, especially continuously, is probably unwise. The environment is intended for DWA development and testing.
